Error: 
Clerk: The <SignIn/> component is not configured correctly. The most likely reasons for this error are:

1. The "/login" route is not a catch-all route.
It is recommended to convert this route to a catch-all route, eg: "/login/[[...rest]]/page.tsx". Alternatively, you can update the <SignIn/> component to use hash-based routing by setting the "routing" prop to "hash".

2. The <SignIn/> component is mounted in a catch-all route, but all routes under "/login" are protected by the middleware.
To resolve this, ensure that the middleware does not protect the catch-all route or any of its children. If you are using the "createRouteMatcher" helper, consider adding "(.*)" to the end of the route pattern, eg: "/login(.*)".
